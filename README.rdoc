= RolloutAdmin

Gem to controll your rollout features via a webinterface. This is the first "not yet clean" version. Please do not use in production environment.

== INSTALL

Add rollout_admin to your Gemfile. Then bundle install. Make sure you have rollout installed as well from nedeco git because rollout_admin relies on the IP address extension.

rollout_admin expects that you have a User model with the attributes "id", "name", "email". Rollout must be initialized and available viw $rollout variable.

Add the following line to your routes.rb: 

  mount RolloutAdmin::Engine => "/rollout_admin"

You will be asked for a username and password. This is "foo/bar".

== TODO

- check dependencies 
- make detailed install instructions
- add configuration for authentication
- make ip feature configurable
- make User model dependency more generic
